          <p>A pivotal 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier is set to ignite the Parc des Princes in Paris this Thursday, November 13, 2025, as a high-flying French side hosts a determined Ukrainian team. With kick-off at 7:45 PM GMT, the stakes could not be higher. A victory for France would punch their ticket directly to the World Cup, while Ukraine is locked in a tense battle to secure a crucial playoff spot.</p>
          <h3>The Scenario: All to Play For</h3>
          <p>For France, the path is clear. Sitting comfortably at the top of Group D, three points ahead of their visitors, a win in front of their home crowd would wrap up a successful qualifying campaign with a game to spare. For Ukraine, the pressure is immense. Led by manager Serhiy Rebrov, they need a positive result to fend off a chasing Iceland and keep their World Cup dreams alive. A draw would be a valuable result, but a win would be a monumental achievement.</p>

          <h2>Team Overviews: A Clash of Styles and Stakes</h2>
          <h3>France: The Star-Studded Favorites</h3>
          <p>Didier Deschamps' Les Bleus come into this fixture in formidable form, unbeaten in their last five matches. Despite their dominance, they will have to contend with a list of injuries to key players like Ousmane Dembélé, Adrien Rabiot, and Aurélien Tchouaméni.</p>
          <p>However, the French squad boasts incredible depth. The attack will be led by the ever-dangerous Kylian Mbappé, who has been in scintillating form. The big news for the hosts is the return of midfield dynamo N'Golo Kanté. After nearly a year away from the national team, his presence is expected to provide a significant boost to their defensive stability and control of the game.</p>
          <h3>Ukraine: The Resilient Underdogs</h3>
          <p>Ukraine has proven to be a tough and resilient side throughout the qualifiers. They arrive in Paris on a three-match unbeaten run, having secured vital victories over Iceland and Azerbaijan. Their disciplined and organized approach, likely a 4-5-1 formation, will be key to frustrating the potent French attack.</p>
          <p>The visitors are not without their own injury concerns, missing forward Artem Dovbyk. They will look to the creative spark of Ruslan Malinovskyi, who has been in fine goal-scoring form, netting three times in his last two appearances for his country. The Ukrainian spirit and work ethic will be tested, as they aim to counter-attack effectively and capitalize on any French errors.</p>

        <div class="content-card">

Five matches have ended in draws. The French are unbeaten in the last five clashes, including a 2-0 win in the reverse fixture earlier in this campaign.</p>
