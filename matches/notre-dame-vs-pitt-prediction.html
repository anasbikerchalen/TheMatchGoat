      <h3>Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs. Pittsburgh Panthers: Tale of the Tape</h3>

      <h4>Why the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Will Win</h4>
      <p>Notre Dame enters this matchup with significant talent advantages and high expectations. Under head coach Marcus Freeman, the Irish have the tools to win tough games on the road.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual-Threat Quarterback:</strong> Riley Leonard gives the Irish offense a dynamic leader. His ability to extend plays with his legs and make accurate throws puts immense pressure on opposing defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Superior Talent & Depth:</strong> Notre Dame consistently recruits at a higher level than Pitt. This advantage in talent and depth, particularly along the offensive and defensive lines, often proves decisive in the fourth quarter.</li>
        <li><strong>Experienced Defense:</strong> The Fighting Irish typically field a fast, disciplined, and physical defense. They have the athletes to contain Pitt's offense and prevent the big plays that could swing the game.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How the Pittsburgh Panthers Can Secure the Upset</h4>
      <p>Pitt thrives in the role of the underdog, especially at home. Head coach Pat Narduzzi has built a program known for its toughness and ability to challenge top-tier opponents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disruptive Defense:</strong> Pitt's identity is its defense. They are known for an aggressive defensive line that excels at generating pressure and stopping the run. Their primary goal will be to make Riley Leonard uncomfortable and force turnovers.</li>
        <li><strong>Hostile Home Environment:</strong> Acrisure Stadium will be a hostile environment. The Panthers will feed off the energy of their home crowd to disrupt Notre Dame's rhythm and create a chaotic, low-scoring game.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical, Grind-It-Out Style:</strong> The Panthers' path to victory is not a shootout. They will look to establish their running game, control the clock, and win a physical, four-quarter battle in the trenches.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Notre Dame vs. Pitt Head-to-Head & Betting Trends</h3>
      <p>This long-standing rivalry is known for its physicality. While Notre Dame holds the historical edge, Pitt has a reputation for playing them tough, especially in Pittsburgh. These games are often closer and more defense-oriented than the talent gap might suggest, making the underdog a compelling bet against the spread.</p>

      <h3>Notre Dame vs. Pitt Prediction & Expert Picks</h3>
      <p>This game projects to be a classic "styles make fights" matchup. Notre Dame's high-end talent and explosive potential will clash with Pitt's gritty, defensive-minded approach. The hostile environment and Pitt's defensive line are the great equalizers. While the Irish are the better team on paper, winning on the road in this rivalry is never easy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moneyline Prediction:</strong> Notre Dame<br>Our expert pick is for Notre Dame to win the game. The talent gap, especially at the quarterback position with Riley Leonard, will ultimately be the difference.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread Prediction:</strong> Pitt to Cover<br>This is the best bet on the board. Pitt's defensive identity and home-field advantage make them a prime candidate to keep this game closer than the experts think. Expect a one-score game, making the Panthers a strong pick to cover the spread.</li>
        <li><strong>Over/Under Total Prediction:</strong> Under<br>A rivalry game featuring a Pat Narduzzi defense in front of a home crowd screams Under. Both teams will lean on their defenses, and points will be at a premium in this physical, grind-it-out affair.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Best Notre Dame vs. Pitt Player Props</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Riley Leonard Over Rushing Yards:</strong> Pitt's aggressive pass rush will force Leonard to use his legs. Whether on designed runs or scrambles, he is a great bet to exceed his rushing yards prop.</li>
        <li><strong>Pitt's Primary Running Back Over Rushing Attempts:</strong> The Panthers' game plan will be to control the clock and establish the run. Their top running back is a strong candidate to get a heavy workload, making the "over" on his rushing attempts a solid wager.</li>
      </ul>
