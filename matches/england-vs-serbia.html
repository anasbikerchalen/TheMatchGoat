          <p>A crucial 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier is set to take place at the iconic Wembley Stadium on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, as an already-qualified England side hosts a Serbian team fighting for their tournament lives. Kick-off is scheduled for 7:45 PM GMT. While the Three Lions have secured their spot in North America, Serbia's hopes of a play-off berth hang precariously in the balance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
          <h2>A Tale of Two Campaigns</h2>
          <p>For England, this match represents an opportunity to continue their flawless qualifying run and for players to stake their claim for a spot in Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad. The Three Lions have been in imperious form, winning all six of their Group K matches without conceding a single goal, while scoring 18 in the process. Having already sealed their place at the 2026 World Cup, the pressure is off, but motivation remains high to impress the manager.</p>
          <p>In stark contrast, Serbia travels to London under immense pressure. A disappointing campaign sees them sitting third in the group, one point behind Albania in the race for a play-off position. This crucial fixture will be the first in charge for new manager Veljko Paunović, who faces a baptism of fire at Wembley. Defeat for Serbia, coupled with an expected win for Albania over Andorra, would extinguish their World Cup dreams.</p>

          <h2>Team Overviews</h2>
          <h3>England: The Confident Hosts</h3>
          <p>Under Thomas Tuchel, England has become a formidable force, breezing through their qualifying group. Their recent outings include a stunning 5-0 victory over this same Serbian side in Belgrade. The team boasts a wealth of talent, with captain Harry Kane leading the line and fresh off scoring six goals in this campaign. The squad welcomes back the influential Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, adding to their creative firepower. However, they will be without the injured Marc Guehi, Nick Pope, Anthony Gordon, and Cole Palmer. Despite qualification being secured, Tuchel is expected to field a strong side as players vie for their seats on the plane to North America.</p>
          <h3>Serbia: The Determined Underdogs</h3>
          <p>Serbia's journey has been turbulent, leading to a recent change in management. The Eagles will be hoping for a "new manager bounce" under Veljko Paunović as they face their toughest test. Their recent form has been shaky, including a damaging 1-0 home defeat to Albania. To add to their challenges, there are concerns over the fitness of star striker Dušan Vlahović, who may miss the clash due to a back issue. Much will depend on the experience of players like Aleksandar Mitrović to inspire a famous upset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
          <h2>Head-to-Head</h2>
          <p>Recent history heavily favors England. The Three Lions have won both of their last two encounters with Serbia as an independent nation. This includes a narrow 1-0 victory during Euro 2024, courtesy of a Jude Bellingham header, and the aforementioned 5-0 demolition in Belgrade in September 2025.</p>
